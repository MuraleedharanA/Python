Title: "Echoes of Yesterday"

The rain never stopped. It fell in sheets, in torrents, relentless and unyielding, as if the world itself had decided to mourn something lost. Mara stood at the edge of the window, watching the water streak down the glass, tracing invisible paths that seemed to lead nowhere. She didn’t know how long she had been standing there, just staring at the rain. Hours? Days? It didn’t matter. The rain had always been there, just as the memories had always been there, clinging to her like an unshakeable fog.

The memories never stopped either. They kept coming, flooding her mind in waves, crashing against the shores of her consciousness. A laugh. A touch. The warmth of a hand in hers. The sound of his voice, soft and reassuring, whispering promises that now seemed so distant, so hollow. "I’ll always be here," he had said. "Always."

The word echoed in her mind now, just like it always did, always repeating itself in the silent spaces between her thoughts. Always. She couldn’t escape it, couldn’t let go of it. Even now, when the rain fell so hard it seemed to drown the world, she heard it. Always.

Always.

The word had become a part of her, a part of the landscape of her mind. It was there in the small things, in the moments that no one else would notice. The way the rain seemed to fall in a perfect rhythm, always the same, always with the same steady beat. The way the clock on the wall ticked, a sound that would always be there, marking the passage of time, but never moving it forward. Always.

She closed her eyes, pressing her forehead against the cool glass. She wanted to escape, to flee from the relentless storm of her thoughts. But there was no escape, not for her. She had tried to run before, tried to outrun the past, but it always caught up with her, always found her in the end.

"Where did it all go wrong?" she whispered aloud, though she already knew the answer. It had been so simple, so small. A decision. A moment. A choice that had seemed so insignificant at the time, but now felt like a fracture, a crack in the foundation of everything she had believed in. That choice had led her here, to this place of loneliness and silence, where the rain never stopped and the memories never ceased.

She turned away from the window, walking slowly toward the kitchen. The sound of her footsteps was muffled by the thick carpet, and for a moment, the world felt distant, as if she were not fully present in it. She reached for the kettle, filled it with water, and set it on the stove. The motions were automatic, a part of her daily routine. But they were empty, devoid of meaning. Just like everything else in her life now.

The kettle began to whistle, a shrill cry that sliced through the stillness of the house. She poured the boiling water into a mug, watching the steam rise in clouds before settling into the air. It was comforting, in a way, this small ritual. But even the comfort of the warm liquid couldn’t ease the ache that had settled deep inside her chest.

Always.

She sat at the kitchen table, cradling the mug in her hands. Her fingers were cold against the porcelain, though the tea was hot. The contrast made her think of him. How he had always been so warm, so steady. How he had always made her feel like everything would be okay. But that had been before. Before the words, before the silence, before the storm.

The word "before" echoed in her mind now, the way "always" had. Before. Before everything had changed. Before she had learned the truth.

She stared into her mug, watching the surface of the tea ripple as she set it down on the table. The ripples spread out in circles, like the way her life had been affected by that one decision. That one choice. That one moment. She couldn’t stop thinking about it, couldn’t stop asking herself what might have happened if she had chosen differently. What if she had left when she had the chance? What if she had said the things she should have said? What if…

"What if…?" she whispered to the empty room, the words floating in the air like the steam from her mug.

But there was no answer, only the silence, only the rain. The silence was deafening, the rain was suffocating, and the memories, the words, the thoughts—they wouldn’t stop. They wouldn’t leave her.

Always.

It was a relentless cycle, a loop she couldn’t break. She had tried, God, how she had tried. She had thrown herself into work, into hobbies, into anything that might fill the void. But nothing worked. Nothing ever worked. She would wake up each day, only to be faced with the same questions, the same ache, the same repetition of the past. She would hear his voice in the back of her mind, like a ghost that refused to leave. "Always."

She took a slow sip of her tea, letting the warmth fill her. It burned her mouth, but she didn’t care. She needed to feel something. Anything.

Suddenly, the sound of the doorbell rang through the house, sharp and jarring. It was unexpected, and for a moment, Mara just sat there, staring at the door as if it were an enemy. Who could it be? Who would come here in the middle of the rain, in the middle of her silence?

She set the mug down with trembling hands, her heart pounding in her chest. Slowly, she stood and walked to the door. The air felt thick, heavy with something she couldn’t name.

She opened the door.

Standing in the doorway was a figure she hadn’t expected, a face she hadn’t seen in so long. His hair was damp from the rain, his coat soaked through, but it was him. The man she had once loved. The man who had said "always," and yet had disappeared from her life.

"Hi," he said, his voice soft, uncertain. "Can I come in?"

Mara didn’t know what to say. She stared at him for a long moment, her mind spinning. She had spent so long wondering what this moment would feel like, imagining every possible scenario, every word that might be spoken. But now that it was happening, now that he was standing there, looking at her with those eyes that she had once known so well, she didn’t know what to do.

"Why are you here?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

He looked down at his feet, then back up at her. "I… I’ve made a lot of mistakes. A lot of mistakes, Mara. And I don’t know if you’ll ever forgive me, but I needed to see you. I needed to tell you that I’m sorry."

The words hung in the air, their weight almost unbearable. "Sorry," she repeated, the word unfamiliar on her tongue. "Sorry."

He stepped forward, and she instinctively took a step back, the distance between them growing, just as it always had.

"You left me," she said, her voice catching in her throat. "You said ‘always,’ and then you left. You never came back. You never—"

"I know," he interrupted, his voice raw. "I know. And I’ve hated myself for it every day since. I’ve been trying to find the right words, the right moment, but there’s never been a right moment. I just—"

"You just what?" Mara’s voice was trembling now, her emotions spilling over. "You just wanted to come back now? After all this time? After everything? What do you expect from me? What do you want me to say?"

He looked at her, his eyes searching hers. "I don’t know. I just want to fix what I broke. I want to make it right, Mara. I know I can’t erase the past, but maybe… maybe we can move forward. Maybe we can start over."

The word "start" hung in the air, heavy and impossible, as if the very idea of starting over was a dream too far out of reach.

But the rain, the rain was still falling. And somewhere in the sound of it, somewhere in the silence between them, Mara heard something shift. Not the past. Not the mistakes. Not the words that had been spoken and forgotten.

But something else. Something new.

Maybe.
